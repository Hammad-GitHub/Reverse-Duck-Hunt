# Reverse-Duck-Hunt
The aim of the game is to dodge the hunter to earn more points.
Use LEFT/RIGHT to move in the corresponding direction, and UP to jump 

Ignore the duck.png and crosshair.png files in the main directory. They serve no purpose. The main sprites being used in the game are ALL in the sprites folder.
